Implement a simple container with annotation in java

##tasks
     
1. container create Injections based on class
    - 1.1 constructor
        1.1.1 inject constructor successfully -15min
        1.1.2 inject more than one constructor -> exception -10min
    - 1.2 field -10min
    - 1.3 method -10min
    
2. injection execution (set dependencies)
    - 2.1 constructor -15min
    - 2.2 field -10min
    - 2.3 method -10min
    
3. bind
    - 2.1 bind interface and impl
        2.1.1 success - 10min
        2.1.2 bind interface to impl not implement interface -> exception -10min
    - 2.2 bind instance -10min
    - 2.3 bind provider -10min
    
4. injection resolve dependencies
    - 4.1 dependence without other dependencies -10min
    - 4.2 dependence with other dependence -15min
    - 4.3 resolve not bind dependency -> exception -10min
    
5. container get instance
    - 5.1 get instance successfully -10min
    - 5.2 get instance not bind -> exception -10min

6. scopes
    - 6.1 @Singleton -15min
